# Overview of features in Ragbits 1.4

This repository is a practical demonstration of new features released in Ragbits 1.4. `reference_main.py` is the
reference application we start with. It is a simple LLM wrapper available to use in a chat interface. `main.py` contains
changes to the app, which were made possible with ragbits==1.4.
